        <h1>Welcome to Amazon Collaboration</h1>
        <p>This is a sample HTML file for the Amazon collaboration.</p>
        <p>This page is a placeholder while the team works on the project.</p>
        <p>The truth is, the developers are out of energy to continue working on this project.</p>
        <p>This project is under construction by humans, not machines.</p>
        <p>This is the best we could do.</p>
        <p>Actual content will appear once we emotionally recover, and energy and motivation return.</p>
        <p>This page exists solely to prove we tried.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Do not feel free to modify this content.</p>
